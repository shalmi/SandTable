- [x] Test Trinamic Drivers
- [ ] Get said Drivers to be configurable...and work better
- [ ] Documentation
- [x] SubClass the Steppers, Arms etc
- [x] Make a state machine
- [x] Make a state where the arm Calibrates
- [x] Make a state where the arm goes to user input position
- [x] Make Theta
- [x] Get Two steppers working siultaniously...at different HZ
- [ ] Make a state where Theta Calibrates
- [x] Make a state where the Theta goes to user input position
